# Agregarr

Agregarr keeps your Plex Home and Recommended fresh by frequently updating it with Collections from various sources, including Trakt, IMDb, TMDB, Letterboxd, MDBList, FlixPatrol (Networks Top 10), AniList and MyAnimeList, as well as generated Collections from Tautulli Statistics, and Overseerr Requests. It has various options for downloading missing media, including as requests through Overseerr, or directly through Radarr/Sonarr. Collections can be reordered on the Home/Recommended and Library tabs independently, and can have time periods or days set for their visibility in Plex.

## Features

## Installation

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  agregarr:
    image: agregarr/agregarr:latest
    container_name: agregarr
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/app/config # Change /path/to/config to your actual config path
      # Linux/Mac: - /mnt/serverdata/configs/agregarr:/app/config
      # Windows:   - C:\serverdata\configs\agregarr:/app/config

      # Optional: For Coming Soon/Placeholder feature
      - /path/to/placeholder/movies:/data/movies
      - /path/to/placeholder/tv:/data/tv
      # Linux/Mac:
      # - /mnt/media/movie-placeholders:/data/movies
      # - /mnt/media/tv-placeholders:/data/tv
      # Windows:
      # - E:\media\movie-placeholders:/data/movies
      # - E:\media\tv-placeholders:/data/tv

      # And then select your root folders in Settings -> Downloads
    environment:
      - TZ=Pacific/Auckland # Set to your local timezone for accurate poster overlay release dates/countdowns - see 'TZ Identifier' column here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
    ports:
      - 7171:7171
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Further instructions for basic setup available [**here**](https://agregarr.org/docs/installation) and Placeholder media volumes [**here**](https://agregarr.org/docs/placeholder-volumes)

The application will be available at `http://localhost:7171`

> **Note**: Your volume must be set correctly for the your settings to persist. If Agregarr is reset after restart, it is because your volume is not set correctly. The Coming Soon/Placeholder feature requires media volumes to be mounted, these folders should be added to Plex, but not added to Radarr/Sonarr. Without media mounts, Agregarr can run remotely and all other features will work normally.
