# App Store for Runtipi

Contains a few apps i want in my environment that arent on the the standard Tipi Store.

## Support

- None - Like i might see it some day but i cant guarantee it.

  Its only a few containers that you either know or need no config.
  Also its only docker anyway - likely something trivial

## Getting Started

1. Add to RunTipi via its settings using the main URL
2. Follow this if unsure - [Add The Store to Runtipi](https://runtipi.io/docs/guides/create-your-own-app-store#add-your-new-store-to-runtipi)
